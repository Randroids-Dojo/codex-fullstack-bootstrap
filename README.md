# Full Stack "Hello World" Bootstrap

> ðŸ¤– **This project was generated with [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex). This is a copy of the experiment ran with Claude Code [here](https://github.com/Randroids-Dojo/typescript-and-python-bootstrap). This is not an amazing experiment because it is basically trying to "one-shot" something complex instead of building more iteratively, but it was a good gauge to see how Claude Code improved with Opus 4. Unfortunately Codex was not able to fully complete the exercise. Specifically, I had to use ChatGPT (with Web Search) to get proper instructions for setting up more obscure libraries like [Better-Auth](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth). Even after getting proper up-to-date knowledge, Codex still struggled to implement the auth use case and kept going in circles. Main has the closest to complete solution. Other branches show other attemps.**

This repository contains a minimal yet functional full-stack monolithic web-application that demonstrates:

* React + TypeScript (Vite) front-end with TailwindCSS & shadcn/ui components
* A stand-alone **Better-Auth** service that handles email / password authentication
* FastAPI back-end that exposes two tiny API routes
  * `GET /me` â€“ returns the currently authenticated user's e-mail
  * `POST /counter/increment` â€“ atomically increments a global counter in Postgres
* PostgreSQL 16 with **Liquibase** migrations for deterministic DB state
* Docker Compose topologies for **development** and **production**

> The implementation follows the blueprint laid out in `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`.

## Prerequisites

* Docker â‰¥ 20.10 and Docker Compose v2

## Running locally (dev)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
# Front-end:  http://localhost:5173
# Auth API:   http://localhost:3001/api/auth/ok
# App  API:   http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Production build

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
# Nginx on http://localhost
```

## Extending the bootstrap

* Add more Liquibase XMLs under `migrations/` â€“ they will be applied automatically.
* Drop additional **Better-Auth** plugins into `auth-service/src/server.ts` for social providers, RBAC, etc.
* Grow the FastAPI or React apps as required; they are regular, fully-featured projects.

Enjoy hacking! âœ¨
