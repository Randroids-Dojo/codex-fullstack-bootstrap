This file will contain a continuous log of the interactive Codex CLI session.

1. Initial request: Implement the plan outlined in docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md

   – Repository initially contained only docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md and LICENSE.
   – Generated full-stack monolithic skeleton following the plan:
     • Docker compose (dev & prod)
     • .env template
     • Backend FastAPI app (Python 3.12) with counter & /me endpoints
     • Auth service (Node 20, Express, Better-Auth email/password)
     • Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite) with Tailwind and auth client
     • Liquibase migrations (counter table)
     • Nginx production proxy configuration

Subsequent CLI interactions will append entries here.

2. 2025-06-12 – Implemented full Better-Auth signup/sign-in flow (without stubs)

   • Added Liquibase change-set 002_create_users.xml and wired master.xml.
   • Expanded backend/models.py with User model.
   • Replaced dummy `current_user` dependency with real PyJWT validation.
   • Added PyJWT to backend/requirements.txt.
   • Re-implemented auth-service:
       – Removed external better-auth dependency.
       – Added PostgreSQL (pg), bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken integration.
       – Implemented /api/auth/signup, /signin, /me & /ok endpoints.
   • Updated auth-service types & Dockerfile remains unchanged (tsc builds fine).
   • Frontend: removed better-auth dep and created tiny `src/lib/auth.ts` utility
     mimicking previous API. Auto-signup fallback added to App.tsx.
   • Added JWT_SECRET to .env.
   • Added @types dependencies; fixed TypeScript build warnings.

   Shortly afterwards the approach was reverted to honor PROJECT_PLAN.md which
   explicitly mandates usage of the official Better-Auth library rather than a
   custom re-implementation.

   Re-work highlights:
     • Restored auth-service to use `better-auth` and its email-password plugin.
       JWT secret is shared via env so FastAPI can validate tokens.
     • Added minimal ambient TypeScript declarations for missing types in
       better-auth & sub-modules to keep `tsc` happy.
     • Front-end switched back to `better-auth/react` helper (with ambient
       typings) and dependency restored in package.json.
     • Removed users table change-set from Liquibase include (Better-Auth manages
       its own schema).  File kept for reference but not executed.
     • Cleaned up extra runtime deps (bcryptjs, pg, jsonwebtoken) that are no
       longer necessary.

   All TypeScript projects compile and the repo realigns with the original
   architectural plan.

3. 2025-06-12 – Docker build failures due to npm registry 503.

   Added robust retry settings & alternate registry mirror inside both
   `frontend/Dockerfile` and `auth-service/Dockerfile`:
     • `npm config set fetch-retries 5`, exponential back-off, + registry switched
       to `https://registry.npmmirror.com` to avoid npmjs outages.
     • Suppress progress logs/audit to speed up CI.

   Build should now be resilient; re-run:
     `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`

4. 2025-06-13 – Fix missing user table migration and table name mismatch

   • Included 002_create_users.xml in migrations/master.xml so Liquibase applies the user table.
   • Renamed the table to 'user' (singular) in migrations/002_create_users.xml to match Better-Auth's queries.
   • On next `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`, Liquibase will create the 'user' table and auth-service no longer errors with relation "user" does not exist.
5. 2025-06-13 – Fix Better-Auth auto-migration invocation

   • Removed erroneous call to `auth.migrate()` (non-existent).  Instead, await `auth.$context` and call `runMigrations()` on the context to apply Better-Auth schema.
   • Now auth-service starts and runs its own migrations against Postgres instead of falling back to in-memory adapter.
